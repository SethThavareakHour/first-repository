Project Title : Number Guessing Game
Programming Language : Python

A number guessing game is a game where the user tries to guess a number that has been randomly generated by the computer. The user is given a limited number of guesses, and if they can guess the correct number within the allotted number of guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose the game.

The objective of the game is to guess the correct number in as few guesses as possible. The player can try to guess any number between the minimum and maximum number, which is usually specified by the game. The player will receive feedback after each guess, such as "too high" or "too low," to help them narrow down the possible number.

The game can be made more challenging by increasing the number of possible numbers, or by limiting the number of guesses that the player has. The game can also be made more fun by adding different elements, such as a timer or a scoring system.

Here are some of the benefits of playing a number guessing game:

-It can improve your problem-solving skills.

-It can help you develop your logic and critical thinking skills.

-It can teach you how to deal with uncertainty and risk.

-It can be a fun and challenging way to pass the time.
